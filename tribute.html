            <h1>Marie Salomea Skłodowska Curie</h1>
            <p>(born Maria Salomea Skłodowska, Polish:  7 November 1867 – 
                4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist 
                and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. 
                She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person 
                and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only 
                person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her 
                husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner on her first Nobel Prize, 
                making them the first ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize 
                and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She 
                was, in 1906, the first woman to become a 
                professor at the University of Paris. (Wikipedia)
